<h2>Knock! Knock! (Knock!) - Who's there? - Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)</h2>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I always wanted to learn Genetic Algorithm (GA) aproach and always thought it is fascinating. So we started with gronki a project 'evolenses' which is about using GA to design a teleskope that has certain properties (just gives <strong>ANY</strong> image, achromat, apochromat etc.). However, it was too hard for me to tackle at once problem of GA and a problem of designing a teleskope. </p>
<p>To do one thing at a time I decided to find a problem that is easy to implement and will let me to deal just wich GA. </p>
<h3>About TSP</h3>
<p>The problem is to visit N places with optimal path (shortest, quickest, longest etc. - depending on a specific problem). As one can easly show, there are N! posibilities so even for N within a range of 20 the problem cannot be solved by brute force. Since GA is commonly used to optimization and TSP is quite easy to implement, TSP seems suited perfectly to learn GA.</p>

<h2>What is my problem?</h2>
<p>I love to travel. I've visited many countries in Europe and I happened to be in south-west USA, I've road tripped along Chile, I've seen Japan - plan to see a lot more including New Zealand. But the time is finite and the question is: how to travel in the optimal way to see everything, instead of bouncing aroung.</p>
<p>My problem is the following: given a set of N capital cities (of a given continent, continents or the whole world) I want to find the shortest path that covers all capital cities.</p>
